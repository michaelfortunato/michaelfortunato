== Work Experience <subsec:Work-Experience>
#work(
  title: [_ Senior Systems Developer - Kernel Group _],
  location: "Cambridge, MA",
  company: "InterSystems",
  dates: dates-helper(start-date: "July 2023", end-date: "July 2024"),
)
- Due to veritable performance in our company's healthcare department, I was
  transferred to become one of the youngest ever members of InterSystem's
  "Kernel group". This is the group of around 12 developers responsible
  for architecting, implementing, and researching the IRIS database, which is
  InterSystem's core technology and is the database powering companies such as
  Epic Systems and Morgan Stanley.
- _Compiler Work_:
  - Developed and improved the performance of ObjectScript, a strongly-typed
    byte-code language (most similar to Java) that is executed within the IRIS
    runtime
  - Improving the speed and modularity of the ObjectScript lexer and parser
  - Conceived of optimizing passes that the ObjectScript compiler could perform
- _Networking_:
  - I wrote the SSH daemon for the IRIS database from scratch in Rust.
    Subsystems dealt with and created included:
    - Read and implemented all the SSH RFCs faithfully for the IRIS daemon
    - Multithreaded, async I/O done with low level usage of
      #link("https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio")[Mio] and higher level
      #link("https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio")[Tokio]
      primitives.
    - Full Authentication Layer (Public Key, Password, Key phrase) with UI and
      distributed systems logic, which was done in consultation with security
      team.
    - All terminal escape sequences implemented
      (e.g. reverse incremental search), which was done via termios and ioctl.
- Wrote in C, assembly, and Rust

  right: dates-helper(start-date: "July 2020", end-date: "July 2023"),
)
- Conceived of, architected, and built the Data Profiling Tool, an enterprise
  grade application for analyzing millions of HL7v2 messages. The application
  included full-stack SSO user authentication, multi-threading, and complex
  scheduling and concurrency management features, along with
  advanced data analytics algorithms with a emphasis on performance acceptable
  to users needs. Technologies included:
  - Solely designed and built database (SQL), manufactured bitmap indexes,
    NLP indexes, and considered normalization layouts verses computation layouts.
  - Built the REST API, working closely with a principal UI developer assigned
    to this project part-time.
  - Created and wrote new _highly performant_ algorithms for analyzing production grade amounts
    of HL7v2 data, in both real-time and offline settings.
- Put on special 1-person team to research the cost of on-boarding new
  hospitals into InterSystems' technology,
  in order to propose a software solution and build that solution. The Data
  Profiling Tool was the end-result of this work.
- Mentored 7 developers. Two of the developers are now technical leads of
  the Data Profiling Tool, the other 5 developers are now working for other
  various companies such as Samsung.

#work(
  company: "Yale Univeristy",
  title: [_Undergraduate Research Assistant to Professor John Lafferty_],
  dates: dates-helper(end-date: "September 2019", start-date: "June 2019"),
  location: [New Haven, CT],
)
- Helped design and build new techniques for estimating joint distributions on
  data with both discrete and continuous components.
- Helped theorize and implement a method that uses Score Matching
  (Siwei Lyu, 2009) for joint density estimation, and a second method that
  used Monotonic Neural Density Estimation
  (Pawel Chilinksi & Ricardo Silva, 2018) for estimating the conditions and a
  Gaussian Copula for linking.
- Demonstrated our work by inferencing the estimating joint distribution to
  generate synthetic data.

#work(
  company: "Univeristy of Chicago Booth School of Business",
  title: [Lead Undergraduate Researcher to Professor William Cong and Tengyuan
    Liang],
  dates: dates-helper(start-date: "January 2018", end-date: "June 2020"),
)

- Lead undergraduate researcher for a team that developed an influential
  algorithm called Textual Factors (Cong, Liang, Lin, 2019),
  resulting in a published paper.
- Important contributor to the development and implementation of the algorithm,
  which uses natural language processing to measure the semantics of a large
  corpus of financial articles (30GB), and then uses statistics to associate
  that measurement with a given share price.
- Received honorable mention for significant contributions in the published
  paper, despite not being listed as an author due to the graduate author
  focus.
